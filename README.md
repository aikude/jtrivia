# jTrivia
This is a user-friendly Trivia application, pre-loaded with 5,100 questions, to get you up and running instantly.

The frontend is built with vanilla (plain) javascript, and the backend is built with Node.js and Express.
The database is SQLite, so you don't need a separate database installation and configuration to
start running this. However since we're using Knex, it'll be easy to port this to another DBMS, if need be.
